Here’s a battle-tested blueprint to build your own omni-channel auto-responder (email/SMS/DM) plus social-media monitoring—using a Python backend, Next.js frontend, Postgres, Redis, and n8n for workflows. I’ll cover architecture, deliverability/compliance, concrete flows, social APIs, sample code, and a short rollout plan.

# 1) What you’re building (capabilities)

* **Email auto-responder**: welcome series, lead magnets, timed drips, behavior-triggered messages, re-engagement.
* **Two-way comms**: auto-reply to inbound emails/DMs/SMS, escalate to human when needed.
* **Social monitoring**: track brand mentions/keywords and auto-respond (where policy allows), route to Slack.
* **Segmentation & personalization**: tags/events drive who gets which sequence.
* **Analytics & A/B testing**: open/click/reply, conversion events, sequence drop-offs.

# 2) Reference architecture (modular, cloud-agnostic)

* **Frontend**: Next.js (lead capture forms, preference center, dashboards).
* **Backend API**: FastAPI (Python) with endpoints for contacts, sequences, events, webhooks.
* **DB**: Postgres (contacts, lists, events, sequences, deliveries); **Redis** for queues/rate-limiting.
* **Workflow engine**: **n8n** (visual sequences, waits, branching, retries) connected via HTTP nodes and webhooks.
* **Message providers**:

  * Email: Amazon SES, SendGrid, or Postmark (use 1 to start; keep provider adapters swappable).
  * SMS: Twilio (optional).
  * DMs: X API, Meta Messenger/IG, Slack/Discord bots (respect each platform’s policy).
* **Event bus**: Webhooks from site/app → FastAPI → enqueue job → n8n executes steps → provider sends.
* **Templating**: MJML → HTML; Handlebars/Jinja variables (first\_name, last\_seen\_product, etc.).
* **Observability**: OpenTelemetry traces; structured JSON logs; Prometheus/Grafana or OpenSearch; dead-letter queue.
* **Secrets**: env vars + secret manager (SOPS, Doppler, 1Password, AWS/GCP Secrets).
* **Infra**: Docker Compose locally; Helm on Kubernetes later (Celery/RQ workers + n8n + API + Postgres/Redis).

# 3) Email deliverability & compliance (non-negotiable)

1. **Authenticate your domain**

   * Set up **SPF**, **DKIM**, and **DMARC**. DMARC builds on SPF/DKIM and tells receivers what to do with failures (none → quarantine → reject) and sends you reports for visibility. ([DMARC][1])
   * DMARC is a DNS TXT record (e.g., `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; aspf=s; adkim=s`). Microsoft’s guide shows the go-from-zero steps. ([Microsoft Learn][2])
2. **Follow CAN-SPAM (U.S.)**

   * Don’t use deceptive headers/subjects; include a physical postal address; provide a working unsubscribe that’s honored promptly. ([Federal Trade Commission][3], [Legal Information Institute][4])
3. **Warm up** a new domain/IP gradually; keep complaint and bounce rates low; segment to engaged recipients first.

# 4) Data model (Postgres, minimal but extensible)

* `contacts(id, email, phone, first_name, last_name, consent_ts, source, status, attributes jsonb, tags text[])`
* `lists(id, name)` & `list_members(list_id, contact_id)`
* `events(id, contact_id, type, metadata jsonb, occurred_at)`  ← page\_view, signup, purchase, reply, mention
* `sequences(id, name, channel, steps jsonb)`  ← steps: delays, checks, message template ids
* `messages(id, contact_id, sequence_id, step, channel, provider_id, status, sent_at, opens, clicks, reply_ts)`

# 5) n8n: three core flows (visual, resilient)

* **Welcome series** (trigger: new `contact.created` with `consent=true`)
  Webhook → DB write → Wait 1h → Email #1 → Wait 2d → conditional (clicked?) → Email #2 or variant → tag “welcomed”.
* **Behavior-triggered** (trigger: `event=purchase_abandoned`)
  Webhook → check last 24h emails → if none, send reminder; else skip; wait; send incentive; stop on purchase.
* **Re-engagement** (trigger: `segment=inactive_90d`)
  Query contacts → batch send “we miss you” with clear opt-down/opt-out.

# 6) Social monitoring & auto-reply (policy-aware)

* **X (Twitter)**: Use the X API v2. Free/Basic tiers are limited; higher-end features like **Filtered stream** require **Pro/Enterprise** per X’s docs. Plan around tier limits before promising real-time firehose. ([X Developer Platform][5])
* **Messenger / Instagram Messaging**: Meta’s **24-hour standard messaging window** applies; promotional content is allowed within 24h of user’s last message, and beyond that you need specific tags/eligibility. Build your automation to check timestamps before replying. ([Facebook for Developers][6])
* Route all **mentions/DMs** into your pipeline → classify with an LLM (priority/sentiment/topic) → auto-reply only when compliant → otherwise open a Slack ticket for a human.
* **Slack bridge**: Notify `#social-triage` with the mention, suggested reply, and quick-action buttons (reply / snooze / escalate).

# 7) Example: minimal FastAPI + SendGrid + n8n hooks

**Send an email (Python, SendGrid)**

```python
# app/email_providers/sendgrid_adapter.py
import os, requests

SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.environ["SENDGRID_API_KEY"]
FROM = ("hello@yourdomain.com", "Your Brand")

def send_email(to_email, subject, html, text=None):
    url = "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send"
    data = {
      "personalizations": [{"to": [{"email": to_email}], "subject": subject}],
      "from": {"email": FROM[0], "name": FROM[1]},
      "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "value": text or ""}, {"type": "text/html", "value": html}],
    }
    r = requests.post(url, json=data, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {SENDGRID_API_KEY}"}, timeout=15)
    r.raise_for_status()
    return r.status_code
```

**Webhook to kick off a sequence**

```python
# app/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from database import create_contact, enqueue_event

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhooks/lead")
async def lead_webhook(req: Request):
    body = await req.json()
    contact = create_contact(body)  # write to Postgres
    enqueue_event("contact.created", {"contact_id": contact.id})
    # Optionally call n8n to start a flow:
    # requests.post(N8N_URL + "/webhook/welcome", json={"contact_id": contact.id})
    return {"ok": True}
```

**n8n welcome flow (pseudo)**

* **Webhook** node `/webhook/welcome` → **HTTP Request** (GET `/contacts/{id}`) → **Wait** (1h) → **HTTP Request** (POST `/send-email` with template `welcome_1`) → **Wait** (2d) → **IF** (clicked last email?) → send variant A/B.

**X mention monitor (requires suitable tier)**

```python
# app/social/x_mentions.py
import os, requests

BEARER = os.environ["X_BEARER_TOKEN"]
def search_mentions(username):
    # Recent search v2, replace with streaming if you have Pro/Enterprise
    q = f"@{username} -is:retweet"
    url = "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent"
    r = requests.get(url, params={"query": q, "tweet.fields":"created_at,author_id"}, 
                     headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {BEARER}"}, timeout=15)
    r.raise_for_status()
    return r.json()
```

# 8) Message templates (MJML → HTML)

* Keep content modular (partials for header/footer/brand).
* Variables: `{{first_name}}`, `{{offer_code}}`, `{{cta_url}}`.
* Build a “template previewer” in Next.js so marketers can edit safely.
* Track links with `?utm_campaign=welcome_1&contact_id={{contact_id}}`.

# 9) Sequences that convert (copy + logic)

* **Lead magnet delivery** (instant) → **Problem-Agitate-Solve** email (24h) → **Proof** (case study, 72h) → **Offer** (day 7) → **Nudge** (day 10).
* **Post-purchase**: receipt + setup guide → “unlock more value” (usage tips) → review/UCG ask (day 14).
* **Re-engagement**: “Still want these emails?” → downgrade frequency → win-back incentive → remove or downsample.

# 10) Analytics & A/B testing

* Store **sends/opens/clicks/replies** per message; compute **sequence funnel** and **time to first reply**.
* A/B on **subject**, **from name**, **send time**, **offer**.
* Dashboards: cohort by signup week; inbox placement proxy (open-rate by provider); complaint/bounce trend.

# 11) Security & privacy

* Principle of least privilege for API keys; rotate quarterly.
* Hash PII fields you don’t need in plaintext; separate table or KMS envelope encryption for emails/phones.
* Access logs; tamper-evident audit trail for opt-outs/consents.

# 12) Platform policy gotchas (build these checks in code)

* **X API**: Different access levels; **Filtered stream** requires Pro/Enterprise. Don’t exceed post/read caps; expect changes. ([X Developer Platform][5])
* **Messenger/Instagram**: **24-hour rule** for promotional content. Your bot should refuse to send promos outside the window or use approved message tags. ([Facebook for Developers][6])
* **Email**: include postal address + working unsubscribe in every commercial email; no deceptive headers/subjects. ([Federal Trade Commission][3])
* **DMARC**: publish a valid record and monitor aggregate (RUA) reports to tighten from `p=none` → `p=quarantine` → `p=reject`. ([DMARC][1])

# 13) Quick MVP stack suggestions

* **Email**: Start with **Postmark** (great deliverability) or **SendGrid** (ubiquitous), but keep a provider interface so you can swap to **SES** later for cost.
* **Open-source helpers**: **Mautic** (full marketing automation) or **Listmonk** (newsletter) if you want to bootstrap faster; still keep n8n for custom flows.
* **LLM add-ons**: subject-line generator, reply classifier, summarizer for social mentions.

# 14) Rollout plan (fast path)

* **Day 1–2**: Domain auth (SPF/DKIM/DMARC `p=none`), provider keys, Next.js capture form, FastAPI `/webhooks/lead`, n8n hello-world flow.
* **Day 3–5**: Welcome sequence (3 emails), preference center, unsubscribe, tracking, Slack alerts, dashboards v1.
* **Week 2**: Behavior-triggered flows, re-engagement, A/B testing. Start social monitoring with whatever X/Meta tier you have.
* **Week 3+**: Tighten DMARC to `quarantine` (then `reject`), add SMS, add human-in-the-loop triage.

---

If you want, I can tailor this to **your exact stack** (providers you already use) and generate:

* ready-to-deploy Docker Compose for API + n8n + Postgres + Redis,
* a minimal Postgres schema + migrations,
* and a couple of copy-ready MJML templates.
